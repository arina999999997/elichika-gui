package button

// implement the SIFAS generic buttons
// these buttons have the characteristic:
// - the size has nothing to do with the texture
// - the texture is usually very small, and the actual button "extend" the texture
// - the method used is to duplicate a column of pixel a few time, leaving the front and back unchanged
// -
